After downloading the Qt installer, transfer it to the Great Lakes cluster using your preferred method.


## 2. Intall QT on the Great Lakes

Next step is to install the qt online installer on the Great Lakes.

Firstly run the following code

```{cmd}
chmod +x qt-online-installer-linux-x64-4.8.1.run
./qt-online-installer-linux-x64-4.8.1.run

In the Select Components part, choose QT version 6.5.8, then wait the installation finished. (Please note that it may takes an hour to finish the installation).

run the following command.
```{cmd}
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Qt/6.5.8/gcc_64/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Run the following code to check if the qt installation is successful.

```{cmd}
qmake --version
```

Run the above code to check if the qt installation is successful.

## 3. Get the  model source code.

Run the following code.

```{cmd}
git clone https://github.com/shengkai866/_installation.git
cd iland_installation
chmod +x iland_build.sh
chmod +x iland_source_code.sh
rm README.md
./iland_source_code.sh
cd ../src/ilandc
```
Then please go to the directory iland_model/src/ilandc and modify the ilandc.pro. Replace the line from 88-97 to the code in the following

Originally Code

To 
```{cmd}
linux-g++ {
    # Use custom FreeImage from Spack installation
    INCLUDEPATH += /home/<UNIQUENAME>/.spack/opt/spack/gcc-13.2.0/freeimage/3.18.0-ko54/include
    LIBS += -L/home/<UNIQUENAME>/.spack/opt/spack/gcc-13.2.0/freeimage/3.18.0-ko54/lib
    LIBS += -lfreeimage
} else {
    # fallback: external freeimage (not used on linux)
    LIBS += -L$$THIRDPARTY_PATH/FreeImage -lFreeImage
}
```

#### replace "UNIQUENAME" to your uniquename.

## 4. Build the model

This is the final step to build the model. Firstly, let us update the environment variable through runing the following code

```{cmd}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/<UNIQUENAME>/.spack/opt/spack/gcc-13.2.0/freeimage/3.18.0-ko54/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
echo '/home/<UNIQUENAME>/.spack/opt/spack/gcc-13.2.0/freeimage/3.18.0-ko54/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Remember to replace the “UNIQUENAME” to your uniquename, The following are example of the above code

```{cmd}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/shengkai/.spack/opt/spack/gcc-13.2.0/freeimage/3.18.0-ko54/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/shengkai/.spack/opt/spack/gcc-13.2.0/freeimage/3.18.0-ko54/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, run the following code to finish the build-up (I assume that you are current in the directory that contains the iland_model, but not in it yet.

For example, you are in the directory "/home/name/iland_installation", the iland_istallation folder contains the iland_model

This process may takes more than half hour.

```{cmd}
./iland_build.sh
```

## 5. Run the Model

Every time you get into the Great Lakes and prepare to run the ILAND model, please run the following command first.

```{cmd}
module load gcc/13.2.0
module load spack
spack load freeimage
```
Then we can run the model, firstly go to the iland-model/build/ilandc folder, then run the following command

```{cmd}
./ilandc path/to/data/folder/example.xml years_simulation
```

##### Replace "path/to/data/folder/example/xml" to the folder that contains the data, also replace years_simulation to the number of the year you want to simulate. The following is an example of the command.

```{cmd}
./ilandc /home/shengkai/example_folder/project.xml
```

After you run the model, you can go to the data folder and find there is another folder called output. Inside the output folder, it is a sqlite database contains the output data.
